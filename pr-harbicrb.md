1. Were you able to reach their endpoint on the web? 
    * Yes! All of the endpoints worked as intended.
2. What did you like about this service?
    * I like the simplicity of the service. It provides something that everyone likes to use and benefits from but implements it in a way that is accessible.
3. What do you think about the paths that have been chosen? 
    * I think that the paths accurately capture all of the indended functionality of the service. They are comprehensive and important.
4. What do you like about the structure of the responses from the different endpoints?
    * The structure of responses makes sense and returns valid data when requested.
5. Describe one significant difference between your own P2 seervice and this person's.
    * One big difference (and something that my group overlooked) was the ability to like posts. We have a similar posting service with likes, but no one is able to like posts currently. In terms of building the front end and maintaining the backend, I think our two projects share the same level of difficulty.
6. Is the code well-structured? 
    * The code is well structured and easy to follow.
7. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    * In my testing I was not able to produce any errors or find any other issues.
8. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author? 
    * One thing you might want to implement is being able to get specific comments from a post. Right now it appears that you need to get a whole post to see any of the comments.
