1. I was able to successfully reach your endpoints from your url, and I was able to make and receive responses from them!
2. I like that users can give their input to your website through comments since that is helpful for both users and owners of the site.
3. I think the paths are easy to understand and match the purpose of their functionality, each is consistent and I do not see any confusion with this.
4. I like that the structure is consistent and they all relate to each other in a way that will make your website useful.
5. We used a similar concept between our projects regarding posts and likes, but I think the only different is that my service uses dates as the endpoints rather than the id.I think yours might be a little easier because it will be easier to find a specific post or delete a post. Yours will also probably be easier to maintain.
6. I believe your code is very well-structured as the endpoints are organized in your index files and each variable and datatype used is easy to understand.
7. The only issue I might see is that when I try to like a post, it does not increment it. I might be doing it wrong, but regardless, it should be a relatively easy fix if it is not working correctly.
8. I do not have much to say in regards to addition to your service. All of your endpoints have a useful purpose and will be fun to see them in actions when the website is fully built. Data shown from your GET endpoints show a good amount, although I would be safe and limit it to like 20 possibly.

Very nice job overall!
